# LA Fire Prediction - Stacking Ensemble Model

This project predicts daily wildfire occurrence in Los Angeles County using an ensemble of Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM models. It leverages meteorological, satellite, and historical fire data to provide early warnings and support sustainable wildfire management.

##  Project Description

Wildfires cause devastating environmental, economic, and human losses.  
Our model uses historical fire data, weather patterns, and satellite imagery to predict wildfire risks with high accuracy.  
The ensemble approach improves robustness and generalization over single models.

##  Sustainability Impact

Accurate wildfire prediction helps:
- Minimize unnecessary patrols, saving fuel and emissions
- Enable targeted evacuations and pre-deployment of resources
- Reduce ecological and economic damage
- Support climate adaptation strategies

Our solution uses open datasets and scalable pipelines, promoting sustainable AI practices.
